### Narrative 3
I embarked on my academic journey towards PhD after I completed my master’s degree in 2022. My path to master’s degree was laden with difficulties and challenges. Despite on this I faced myself driven by a newfound motivation to profiling towards pursuing PhD.

I ventured into the realm of doctoral studies on the determination to excel and grow professionally. Expand my knowledge and expertise but also aimed to cultivate skills and shape into proficient for my future endeavors.

This PhD journey would not have been possible without the help of God and my family.

### Narrative 4
So I graduated my Master’s degree in Information Technology at the University of Cordilleras in 2018. It was hard sleepless night but worth it experience as an enthusiast in technology knowing that I still have empty spaces to fill as my career continuous to be challenged while marking a better life out of it.

And now that I am looking forward and stay focused again while on my PhD milestone. I am anticipating for a double or even triple hard work and the beginning of sleepless nights again while burning my head and immerse in all my subject requirements. But still I am grateful because I was able to step up and help grow once more.

I took this PhD degree in Technology Education Management since I have a role in our school that revolves around the management and operations. And I believe that I am in the right course track. I really enjoy attending all my subjects and learned from every lesson and participate in activities. Though pressure is sometimes there still I am grateful.

And what I expect in due time my PhD degree will remain a pleasant history and worth to tell for.

### Narrative 5
My choice and my life decisions wasn’t an easy one. Most of the time I still need to ask/consult suggestions comments and opinions of other people. Those opinions and suggestions are very relevant for me because these guide me on doing/pursuing something.

The time I decided to pursue my masters was an exciting one. I was really the ideal type of person/student where I want all things to be planned. Like after my undergraduate course I planned to enroll eventually in my masters but due to some unforeseen events my excitement ends when I was already employed in the school. I was overwhelmed with bulk of paper works and activities. My excitement going and studying my masters changed to laziness but as time passes-by-in the school that I am employed they made it as part of the requirement to be given a temporary status and same with to be permanent. So I eventually started and continued pursuing my masters.

During my masters I was fascinated and excited on working in the field of science specifically in science education. The professors were really passionate understanding and patient with us. They totally developed our critical thinking skills and equipped us with different pedagogies in teaching and learning science. I particularly enjoyed my subject in handling laboratory techniques and working on how to teach and provide strategies to students in a simple way. However there are some questions still that are unanswered and I craved the opportunity to have a deeper exploration to contribute in the body of knowledge by continuing the journey of my PhD dream.

In pursuing my PhD still it wasn’t an easy decision because of the assigned workloads and some designations given to me. I also don’t want to lose the opportunity of some of the thrown designations and also do not want to compromise my work and in the pursuit of my education in PhD. However someone convinced me to pursue my PhD and eventually letting me realized how important taking PhD not only on my professional development but also for me to be more competitive and part of its is I also want to be called a doctor not in medical/medicine but in education.

I know my PhD journey will not be easy but expect to be challenged intellectually in ways I never have been before. I am very eager to develop my research skills since it is really a need in my education and my profession and learn to all the esteemed professors and collaborate with other brilliant students. As of the moment this is my first semester to be enrolled in PhD and I believe and I know this will be a marathon not a sprint. I am committed and I will be preparing for the long haul with unwavering dedication resilience and thirst in learning knowledge together with all my companions-my classmates. It may be difficult in the long – run and I believe it will all be worth-it in the end.
